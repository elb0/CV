# Biography

I’m a tea drinking Aucklander with a Canadian accent, and I really, really like talking, thinking and learning about statistics. I teach introductory statistics, research in the health and administrative statistics space and help people get their data needs sorted. I’ve worked with a range of clients from education, not-for-profit, and industry sectors. My idea of a good time is helping people have the “aha!” moments that lead to better insights and decision making, and more critical consumption of statistics.
